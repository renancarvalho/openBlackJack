# Open BlackJack
This is the open version of the famous game BlackJack (work in progress) built in JS, the main idea of this project is to study `socket.io` and `js` in general. 

Here you will probably find more advanced usage of socket.io, like sending messages to a specific socket.id, broadcasting messages, creating rooms (tables) dynamically, etc. Of course you're invited to help this repo and create a good code base with good examples of socket.io power, but remember this is a work in progress, it's not done yet.

### How to run?
Go to `front/` run `npm install` and then `gulp run`. Also go to `server/`, run `npm install` and then `npm start`. Gulp will open the browser automatically.

### How to run the tests?
Go to `server/` and run `npm test`.


### How to study together or contribute?
Just fork it and create a pull request.

### Next steps?

* Make the game 'wait' for the next person to play
* Create tests for models (understando how to do that with socket)
// A thousand things more!


### How to play?
Well the game is not ready yet, but you can play by running the project locally.
